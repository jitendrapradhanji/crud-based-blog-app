            <h4>A blog is an online journal or informational website displaying
                information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a
                platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject. There are many
                reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging.
                Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward
                purpose â€“ to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility. As a business,
                you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging
                to help you get to potential consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would
                remain invisible.</h4>
